# Understanding `git pull.rebase` and `git pull.ff only`

`git pull.rebase` and `git config pull.ff only` are both Git configuration options that affect how Git handles the merging of local and remote branches during a git pull operation.

## `git pull.rebase`

Purpose: To rebase your local commits onto the remote branch's tip, creating a linear commit history.

### Process:

- Git fetches the latest commits from the remote branch.
- Git temporarily creates a new branch to hold the fetched commits.
- Git reapplies your local commits on top of the new branch, effectively "rewriting" their history.

If there are conflicts, you'll need to resolve them before continuing the rebase.
Once the rebase is complete, Git deletes the temporary branch.

### Advantages:

Cleaner history: Creates a more linear and easier-to-follow commit history.
Avoids merge commits: Reduces the number of merge commits, which can simplify history navigation.
Disadvantages:

Rewrites history: Can be confusing if you're sharing your repository with others, as it changes the commit IDs.
More complex: Rebasing can be more complex than merging, especially when dealing with conflicts or large repositories.

## `git config pull.ff only`

Purpose: To perform a fast-forward merge only, avoiding merge commits.

### Process:

Git fetches the latest commits from the remote branch.
If your local branch is already up-to-date with the remote branch and there are no conflicting changes, Git simply moves the pointer of your local branch to the latest commit on the remote branch.

### Advantages:

Simple and efficient: Fast-forwarding is straightforward and doesn't require any additional work.
Preserves history: Doesn't rewrite history, making it easier to collaborate with others.
Disadvantages:

Limited to fast-forward only: If there are conflicting changes, a fast-forward merge is not possible, and Git will revert to a regular merge.

## Choosing the Right Option:

If you prefer a clean, linear commit history and don't mind the complexity of rebasing, `git pull.rebase` might be a good choice.
If you want to avoid rewriting history and prefer a simpler approach, `git config pull.ff only` is a suitable option.
